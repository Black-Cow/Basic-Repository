CHALLENEGE ONE

/*

Write a program for a school which produces some statistics on the student's exam results.
The teachers are to input the test results which will then be stored in an array.

The program should output two things:

1. Each student's score and percentage for the exam.
2. The mean score and percentage of the exam.

Considerations:

1. Have the program ask how many students took the exam, set the array cap to that.
2. Have the program know what the max possible score is.
3. You can refer to each student as a number if you want e.g Student 1: 98%

CHALLENGE TWO 
                                                 
/*

Write a program that asks people true or false questions and displays the answer to the user.
At the end of the program, display the user's score.

Considerations
1. Use three arrays for this: A string array for holding the questions, a boolean array for the answers, another boolean array for the user's answers
2. You can use nextBoolean() to get the next answer
3. Because we have three separate arrays that need to work together, we can reference them consistently by using indexes.

/*

Write a program in which you define a number between 1 - 100 and the program tries to guess it .

Every time it guesses wrong, you type "wrong" and it re-guesses. When you type "correct" it should end.
